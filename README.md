Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

Contents

Machine Learning
•	Supervised Learning and Imbalance Data : Home Credit Default Risk : Home Cred-it strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of approaches --to predict their clients' repayment abilities. The Data is highly complex stored in separate tables, that includes static data of all application, all clients previous credits provided by other financial institutions, monthly balance of previous credits, history of monthly balance of POS- point of sales and cash loans,  monthly history of previous consumer credits and cash loans, monthly history of previous credit card transaction of the applicants, Repayment installment history of every pay-ment made and missed.
•	Supervised Learning : Nomad2018 Predicting Transparent Conductors : Exploratory Analysis  and Prediction of Transparent conductors datasets hosted by Kaggle, to predict the new semi conducting elements that gives best properties which combined together gives the Formation Energy and Bandgap Energy.
•	Imbalance Data : TalkingData AdTracking Fraud Detection Challenge : Identification and Detection of fraud mobile users from the dataset hosted by Kaggle. The dataset contained highly imbalance data with almost 99% fraud mobile apps  click that need to be predicted so that TalkingData company can  prevent such fraud app clicks.
•	Time Series : Forecasting the passengers trend for JetRail : Forecasting of daily and monthly passengers count that will help JetRail for investment decision making. The dataset was hosted by Datahack.   
•	Predicting and Forecasting: Apple’s Products and Sales : Country wise Analysis and Pre-diction of Apple’s products and sales and forecasting of their quarterly sales using various ML models and SQL.  

Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib,Numpy

Natural Language Processing
•	Twitter Sentiment Analysis : Classification of Tweets (positive, negative, neutral) using scikit learn and NLTK's sentiment analysis.

Tools: NLTK, scikit

Data Analysis and Visualisation
Python
•	Home Credit Default Risk: Exploratory Analysis of all datasets in Home Credit hosted on Kaggle using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn visualisations. Demonstrates extraction of useful features, aggregation and validations from different feature or variables.
Tools: Pandas, Folium, Seaborn and Matplotlib


Micro Projects:
Python

•	Enron Financial Fraud Detection: Analysis of Enron employees who were involved in the Enron scam through their accounts, assets, stocks and share, email transaction.
•	SMS Spam detection and Classification : Analysis of SMS to build a predictive  model to identify and classify spam SMS from normal SMS.
•	ML with Logistic Regression, ensemble methods : Using Logistic Regression, Random forest classifier, Extratrees Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier,  XGBoost etc.,  to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
•	ML with K Nearest Neighbours: Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
•	ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a SMS is a SPAM or not.
